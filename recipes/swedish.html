      Swedish meatballs, or "k√∂ttbullar" in Swedish, are a classic and beloved
      dish that has gained international popularity. These meatballs are
      typically made from a mixture of ground meat, often a combination of beef
      and pork, mixed with breadcrumbs, finely chopped onions, and a blend of
      seasonings such as salt, pepper, and sometimes spices like allspice or
      nutmeg.
